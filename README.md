## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS


### What I learned

This project has taught me a lot - there are still some gaps in my knowledge of HTML and CSS. I also beginning to appreciate CSS more - as it is a powerful tool and thus can create beautiful websites. I want to be able to have the opportunity to further develop my skills as to make beautiful websites and art through CSS.

This could have been built in more efficiently but this is an aspect that I appreciate and will learn over time - as right now, my priority is to get my knowledge secured and strong and efficiency will then be something I will pick up on the way. I am also getting my head around version control, git and github.

### Continued development

Practice, practice, practice!!! Creating bigger projects and integrating it with other languages to create backend part
